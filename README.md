**Pre-pre-pre-alpha code**

This is a demo of wxErlang, inspired by and shameless rewrite of the
[wxPython
demo](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxPython/tree/master/demo). Not
only is it intended to show the use of the different widgets, it also
demonstrates how a GUI application can be structured. For me, this
project is to get familiar with wxErlang.
